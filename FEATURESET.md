# What is this?

This is a list of features that need adding, improving, or that already work in the site. This file is where I kind of control what I'm doing and what I need to get done.

# Features that work
* **Gathering of skills:** I have a better picture of what I know and what I'm learning. I don't need to waste more time thinking what technologies I am aware of. Yet it could be improved as there's many more that are not written there.

* **Writing articles:** The main goal of a platform in which it was easier to write my notes than on MediaWiki but with basically the same goal is accomplished.

* **SEO:** I've got full control of SEO even though I'm using Angular.

# Features that need implementing

* A proper user login mechanism. But this depends on the final backend. I'm testing the waters with Flask now. So I could learn two different technologies at once.

* **Autosave** I need to decide if it'll just save whatever I'm writting every 30 seconds and where, if it'll have any sort of version control. This could change the entire way the DB documents are stored.

# Optional features.

* **Multiuser** I'm not sure this is necesary because the goal is a personal site to keep on top of your own learning. It doesn't make much sense for it to be multiuser.
