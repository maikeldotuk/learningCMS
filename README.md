This is a CMS to keep track of your own learning. Instead of dividing it in pages like Wordpress it is divided in skills and each skill in sub-skills. 
It is the evolution of the MediaWiki environment that is now kept for comparison in https://www.maikel.uk/old 

The MediaWiki format has a few shortcomings:
* Editing text is cumbersome.  
* Adding pictures is a hindrance.  
* Adding CSS is an incredible annoyance because you do it globally in Commons.CSS
* Adding Javascript is the same because you do it globally in Commons.JS
* To add a new skill I had to manually create a table each and every time or copy-paste one I already did. 

This CMS automatises or solves all of the previous shortcomings of MediaWiki by:
* Using Froala Editor a WYSIWYG solution. 
* Using Angular for Componentisation of both CSS & Javascript. 
* Automatising the creating of skillboxes.
